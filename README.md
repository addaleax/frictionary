Hey! This is just a small project of mine for game nights with friends
where you can play [Fictionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictionary).

It fetches the first paragraphs from Wikipedia articles and diplays them;
Itâ€™s far from perfect yet, so if you want something changed (or want to
change something yourself!), please contact me here or at the e-mail address
provided on the online version.

You will need a recent version of Node.js and CouchDB set up in order to run
this project locally.
